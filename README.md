# DeepChess-AI

Play chess against a Neural Network based AI. 

## DETAILS

The AI - implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning uses a neural network based score function.

The score function is based on the following academic paper:

[DeepChess: End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Automatic Learning in Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09667)
